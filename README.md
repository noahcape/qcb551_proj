## Contributions to project update:

Noah Cape: Wrote code for all clustering methods, computing similarity matrices, as well as producing and parsing bag of words embeddings. Created Figure 4.
  
Bryan Chang: Wrote code to parse metrics and make figures. Polished figures in Illustrator.  Created Figure 2.
  
Joseph Clark: Ran code to cluster embeddings and saved the data. Trained random forest classifier. Plotted embeddings colored by ground truth labels. Created Figure 5.
  
Maxwell Soh: Wrote code to generate pLM embeddings and visualize their distribution. Created Figure 1.
  
Jeffrey Zhong: Wrote code for evaluating cluster mappings to true labels and computed canonical correlation. Created Figure 3.
